title: "FAQ"
description: "Frequently Asked Questions"

q-info: "What does this mod do?"
a-info: "This mod lets you create scripts in JavaScript language to manage your server, add new blocks and items, change recipes, add custom handlers for quest mods and more!"

q-how-use: "How to use it?"
a-how-use: "Run the game with mod installed once. It should generate a `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts and README.txt. Read that!"

q-js-help: "I don't know JavaScript"
a-js-help: "There's examples and pre-made scripts here. And you can always ask in discord support channel for help with scripts, but be specific."

q-reload: "Can I reload scripts?"
a-reload-st: "{st-s}: Restart the game or use `/kubejs reload startup_scripts`. Not everything is reloadable - some things require you to restart the game (e.g. registries) or the world (e.g. worldgen)."
a-reload-se: "{se-s}: Use `/reload` to reload scripts, recipes, tags and all data or `/kubejs reload server_scripts` to reload scripts only"
a-reload-cl: "{cl-s}: Use `F3 + T` to reload scripts and assets or `/kubejs reload client_scripts` to reload scripts only"

q-mod-support: "What mod recipes does it support / is mod X supported?"
a-mod-support: "If the mod uses datapack recipes, then it's supported by default. Some more complicated mods require addon mods, but in theory, still would work with datapack recipes. See {recipes-url} and {addons-url} sections for more info."

q-features: "What features does this mod have?"
a-features: "See <features-url>."

q-how-work: "How does this mod work?"
a-how-work: "It uses a fork of Rhino, a JavaScript engine by Mozilla to convert JS code to Java classes at runtime. KubeJS wraps minecraft classes and adds utilities to simplify that a lot and remove need for mappings. {arch-api} lets nearly the same source code be compiled for both Forge and Fabric making porting extremely easy."

q-support: "Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?"
a-support: "You can report issues [here]({support-url})."

q-discussion: "I have more questions/suggestions!"
a-discussion: "If wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord server]({discord-url}) and ask for help on [#kubejs-support]({discord-url}) channel!"

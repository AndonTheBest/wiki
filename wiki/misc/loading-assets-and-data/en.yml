p1: "You can also use KubeJS to load assets from resource packs and data from datapacks! While this isn't the only method, its one of the easiest. Other options are <TODO: make and link server datapack load page and client generate assets event page>"
p2: "The data folder is loaded identically to the data folder in a datapack. If you already have a datapack just copy the folder(s) from inside the datapacks data folder to KubeJS' data folder."
p3: "The assets folder is loaded identically to the assets folder in a resourcepack. If you already have a resourcepack just copy the folder(s) from inside the resourcepacks assets folder to KubeJS' assets folder."

The `client_scripts` folder contains scripts which are loaded every time client resources reload.
They are used for:
- JEI/REI events
- tooltips
- etc.
You can reload all code inside of this folder by pressing F3 + T, or you can reload all code outside of any event listeners by running `/kubejs reload client_scripts`.

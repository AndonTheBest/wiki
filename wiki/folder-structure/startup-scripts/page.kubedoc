The `startup_scripts` folder contains scripts which are used for things which require a full game restart.
They're used for:
- registering items/blocks
- modifying existing items/blocks
- adding forge event listeners
- etc.
You can reload all code inside of this folder by restarting the game, or you can reload all code outside of any event listeners by running `/kubejs reload startup_scripts`.

The `server_scripts` folder contains scripts which are loaded every time server resources load (world load, `/reload`).
They're used for:
- adding/removing recipes
- adding/removing tags
- modifying loot tables
- handling server events, like a player right clicking a block
- etc.
You can reload all code inside of this folder by running `/reload`, or you can reload all code outside of any event listeners by running `/kubejs reload server_scripts`.

# German (Deutsch)

- The word "mod" is a female noun: die Mod(ifikation)
- Use the informal "du" (lowercase!) instead of "Sie"
- Anglicisms are allowed if it is more concise than the German equivalent, for example:
  - "mod" => "Mod" instead of "Modifikation", "event" => "Event" instead of "Ereignis", etc.
  - "default options" => Both "Default-Optionen" and "Standardeinstellungen" are okay
  - "default keybind" => "Standard-Tastenbelegung" is preferred to "Default-Keybind"
- As with all other languages, links and version numbers should not be translated
